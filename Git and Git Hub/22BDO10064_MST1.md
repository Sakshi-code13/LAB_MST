# LAB MST (GIT AND GITHUB) ON 13-03-2024
## PROBLEM STATEMENT (MODULE A)

## Basic local workflow: Part – 1
Related – Git basic local workflow
Main Task
1. Create a new directory and change into it.
2. Use the init command to create a Git repository in that directory.
3. Observe that there is now a .git directory.
4. Create a README file.
5. Look at the output of the status command; the README you created should appear as an untracked file.
6. Use the add command to add the new file to the staging area. Again, look at the output of the status command.
7. Now use the commit command to commit the contents of the staging area.
8. Create a src directory and add a couple of files to it.
9. Use the add command, but name the directory, not the individual files. Use the status command. See how both files have been staged. Commit them.
10. Make a change to one of the files. Use the diff command to view the details of the change.
11. Next, add the changed file, and notice how it moves to the staging area in the status output. Also observe that the diff command you did before using add now gives no output. Why not? What do you have to do to see a diff of the things in the staging area? (Hint: review the slides if you can’t remember.)
12. Now without committing, make another change to the same file you changed in step 10. Look at the status output, and the diff output. Notice how you can have both staged and unstaged changes, even when you are talking about a single file. Observe the difference when you use the add command to stage the latest round of changes. Finally, commit them. You should now have started to get a feel for the staging area.
13. Use the log command in order to see all of the commits you made so far.
14. Use the show command to look at an individual commit. How many characters of the commit identifier can you get away with typing at a minimum?
15. Make a couple more commits, at least one of which should add an extra file.

## Steps:-

Step 1: Firstly, we will make a repository named as LAB_MST, which will consists of all the practicals of the Semester 4. 
We will seregate the folders according to the subjects. Therefore, we made the Git and Git Hub folder. And, add one 22BDO10064_MST1.md file in which all the information will be attached. 

Step 2: According, to the above problem statements, create a new directory and change into it by using the command 
         **$ mkdir mst**
         **$ cd mst**

Step 3: Now, initialize the git repository in that directory by using the command 
        **$ git init**

Step 4: Observe, that there is now, a .git directory

Step 5: For creating a README file.
        **$ touch README.md**

Step 6: Now, look at the output of the status command, 
        **$ git status**

Step 7: For, adding the new file and again looking at the output of the status command 
        **$ git add README.md**
        **$ git status**

Step 8: For, committing the contents into the staging area
        **$ git commit -m "First commit"**

Step 9: Create a src directory and add a couple of files to it.
        **$ mkdir src**
        **$ touch src/file1.txt src/ file2.txt**

Step 10: Now, use the command, but name the directory, not the individual files. Use the status command. See how both files have been staged. Commit them.
        **$ git add src**
        **$ git status**
        **$ git commit -m "Add files into the src directory"**

Step 11: For, making changes to one of the files and the diff command to view the details of the change,the commands will be 
        **$ cat> src/file1.txt**
        **$ git diff**
        
Step 12: Now, next add the changed file, and notice how it moves to the staged area in the status output.
        **$ git add src/file1.txt**
        **$ git status**
        **$ git diff --staged**

Step 13: **$ cat> src/file1.txt**
        **$ git status**
        **$ git diff**
        **$ git add src/file1.txt**
        **$ git status**
        **$ git commit -m"New changes into the file1.txt"**

Step 14: **$ git log**

Step 15: **$ git show <commit_id>**

Step 16: **$ git touch src/file3.txt**
         **$ git add src/file3.txt**
         **$ git commit -m"Added file 3 into the src directory"**
